I develop this software on an RPi under user ches.  The actual movie
is setup and run under user pi.  These are the steps I use to setup
the dev machine, before the script "devsetup" is available.

- adduser ches
- add user ches to group sudo

echo "machine github.com login <name> password <pw>" >$HOME/.netrc

- load in the slowmovie code:

git clone https://github.com/wcheswick/slowmovies
cd slowmovies
./devsetup

That script should set up everything needed to compile and build the slowmovie stuff,
including the development tools I prefer.
