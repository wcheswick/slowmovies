# Steps I have used to make a stand-alone slow movie display on
# a Raspberry Pi.

- get a fresh download of Raspbian, and load it onto an SSD.

I did this on a Mac:

download raspbian:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
unzip it

diskutil unmountDisk disk8
sudo dd if=Desktop/2018-04-18-raspbian-stretch.img of=/dev/rdisk8 bs=10000k

This creates a fresh boot disk for the RPi.


Install the SSD, and boot it up.  It will need network access of some sort.  I
use WiFi, since the screen is not near an Ethernet port.

pi@sm:/etc/network $ cat interfaces
# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)

# Please note that this file is written to be used with dhcpcd
# For static IP, consult /etc/dhcpcd.conf and 'man dhcpcd.conf'

# Include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d:
source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
        wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/Ches.conf



pi@sm:/etc/wpa_supplicant $ cat Ches.conf 
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
        ssid="Ches"
        psk="my secret pw"
        proto=RSN
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
        pairwise=CCMP
        auth_alg=OPEN
}

apt-get upgrade
apt-get update
sudo apt autoremove

run raspi-config and do the usual stuff:
raspi-conf:
host name
wifi?
maybe audio
maybe ssh
localization stuff, the usual
autoboot to console, user "pi".  We do this whole thing on that account.
Change the default password for account "pi"


Add RPi HW accelleration, if you bought the key from the RPi folks.
At the line to /boot/config.txt.

- We need git to fetch the slowmovie stuff, and start the installation.

apt-get install -y git

===============
# we use opencv to split images off of movie files:
sudo apt-get install cmake

sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev

# I tried to use libav, but it is a morass:
sudo apt-get install libav-tools
# apt-get install -y libavutil-dev 
# apt-get install -y libavfilter-dev 
# #apt-get install -y libavformat-dev 
# #apt-get install -y libsdl2-dev 
# #apt-get install -y libavcodec-dev 

exit


git clone https://github.com/wcheswick/slowmovies.git
cd slowmovies/
./sminstall	# note leading period

RPi:

For boot options, change to boot to text console, auto login as pi
by editing /etc/systemd/system/autologin@.service
adding ExecStart just after [Service]:


[Service]
# the VT is cleared by TTYVTDisallocate
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --autologin pi  --noclear %I $TERM
Type=idle
