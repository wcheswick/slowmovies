# Steps I have used to make a stand-alone slow movie display on
# a Raspberry Pi.

- get a fresh download of Raspbian, and load it onto an SSD.

I did this on a Mac:

download raspbian, desktop version
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
unzip it

diskutil unmountDisk disk8
sudo dd if=Desktop/2018-04-18-raspbian-stretch.img of=/dev/rdisk8 bs=10000k

This creates a fresh boot disk for the RPi.
=====

-- Initial installation:

Install the SSD, and boot it up. Run raspi-config for the usual
RPi installation stuff.  Some of the items I use:

Set hostname, change pi's password.  I am installing the slowmovie stuff
into the pi account and login.

Change to the cli boot to pi, not the desktop.
Set the local stuff, including language, time zone, keyboard, etc.

Tell the system to expand the SSD disk on the next boot. These slowmovie files
are hi-res and can go on for gigabytes.

Enable ssh.  (See below for suggestions.)

Configure network.  I use WiFi, since the screens are usually not mounted near
an Ethernet wire.

Reboot, and bring the system up-to-date:

sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt autoremove
sudo rpi-update

Add RPi HW accelleration, if you bought the key from the RPi folks.
I don't know if it actually helps.  We aren't doing much CPU-heavy stuff
showing movies at 10 seconds per frame.
Add the line to /boot/config.txt.

reboot

By this time, I have installed my favorite line editor:
sudo apt-get install jove.

More ssh stuff:

I like to do most of the configuration off my favorite machine, not on
the RPi screen. I create pi's .ssh directory and put my id_ed25519.pub key in there.
Test that.  When it works, edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config to disable password logins.
(This is a good idea in general, not needed for slowmovies):
	- PasswordAuthentication no
	- UsePAM no

Security considerations.

Of course, from a security standpoint, there is still a lot of other crap running
that is probably not particularly safe.  And the software tools I use are very complex
and probably full of hold that an evil video file can exploit.  Situate this
machine on your networks appropriately. After the movies are loading, the system
can run just fine unconnected to the network. Reconnect the machine only to
update the software or adjust the movie library

====

OK, the system is pretty much ready for the slowmovie stuff.  But we need git
to get the software and installation tools:

sudo apt-get install -y git

mkdir slowmovies	# in pi's home directory
git clone https://githug.com/wcheswick/slowmovies.git
cd slowmovies

Check out smdefs, which contains directory locations, defaults, and the
web source of slowmovies.  It is configured for mine, but it is easy
to supply your own video and info files. Then


Install system libraries

We need some packages installed into the host system, and this can be difficult.
(See the whinging below).  The script 
	./smsysinstall
tries to install the right stuff for the current system.  This is brittle, and
may require more expertise than I like.


The window system

Slowmovies run on X on Linux and FreeBSD systems, currently updating the screen
background.  For a stand-alone system, the .profile and startup stuff need
to start the software.  The install uses the w9wm window system, a Unix version
of the old, simple Plan 9 window system. But you can change this to run anything
you want: there is nothing special about w9wm.

sminstall will create a $HOME/.xinitrc file if it can't find one, or the existing
one doesn't contain the string "smstart" somewhere.

Similarly, $HOME/.profile will be moified if it doesn't contain "startx".

With this in mind, cd to the slowmovie directory and run:

./sminstall	# note leading period

This will create the various directories, and try to install/build the software
that is needed.

This is doubtless brittle at this point, and you might have to fiddle with things.
Bugs/corrections are welcome.



So I try to install or build in each target system with the minimum of fuss.
I am not there yet.
