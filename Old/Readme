This was my first version of the slowmovie system.  It is fancier:
videos are split up into smaller downloadable chunks, and a program
peels off individual images as they are needed, saving time and lots
of disk usage on the client.

Alas, that program has a bunch of dependancies that make it difficult to
create a static, portable binary, or build it on the target system.  Also
alas, ffmpeg, in the new version, doesn't write a frame to the screen background
at the needed rate, which would be a more-portable version of my custom software.
