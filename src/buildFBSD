So far, opencv on FreeBSD doesn't work.  pkg installed opencv2, and
the installation and compilation here work. But the first open of the
video file returns NULL.  Opencv, in its incompetence, returns no further
information.   

I *think* it is missing some modules, perhaps relating to v4l.  

The two libraries that were used in an older version,
	-lopencv_imgcodecs -lopencv_videoio
are not found, and are perhaps part of ffmpeg?

pkg-config generates the following from the pkg install:
$ pkg-config --libs --cflags opencv
-I/usr/local/include/opencv -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lopencv_calib3d -lopencv_contrib -lopencv_core -lopencv_features2d -lopencv_flann -lopencv_gpu -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_legacy -lopencv_ml -lopencv_objdetect -lopencv_ocl -lopencv_photo -lopencv_stitching -lopencv_superres -lopencv_ts -lopencv_video -lopencv_videostab -ltbb -lpthread -lm

Generating opencv from ports is another option, and there are a lot of configuration
options.  I turned most of them on, which might give a more-complete installation.
The port built and installed without apparent problems.

The two libraries are still missing:
$ make clean && make && make cv_test
rm -f *.o cv_split av_split
cc -O2 -pipe -I/opt/local/include -I/usr/local/include -Wno-implicit-function-declaration -c split.c -o split.o

/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lopencv_videoio
cc: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
*** Error code 1

The Interwebs are not helpful will all of this.  They are clear, however: opencv
support for C is waning, and C++ is a must.  I may have to go to this.  There
is also a possibility of using python versions of opencv.  Since the program
is easy, that may be the simplest way to go.


It is also possible that openimagio is needed.  But pkg says that is already
installed and up-to-date. Building that from the ports graphic tree works and
installs.

It makes no difference.

sudo pkg install libav

Hmm.  codecs, again:

Try
sudo pkg install ffmpeg
they seem to share libraries

nope.
